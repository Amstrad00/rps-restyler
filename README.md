## Features

- Removes the big spotlight at the top of the site - it's just too huge.
- Removes the sidebar stuff completely and centers the actual blog content.
- Turns the header dark and makes it look nicer in general.
- Should fix any site width issues - no more horizontal scrollbars.
- Makes the background white slightly less blinding.
- Makes various buttons bigger and easier to click.
- Reduces unnecessary whitespace.
- Hides all ads. Supporter banners are kept to encourage supporting otherwise.
- Improves and fixes colors in comments. RPS Staff and Supporters get their own colors.
